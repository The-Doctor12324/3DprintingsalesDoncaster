<h3> IF YOU WANT A CUSTOM ORDER READ THIS<h3>
<p> If you want your own order you will have to contact me and state the exact size you want your design to be all you have to do is
provide me with an STL file via email or wherever you contact me from. Depending on size prices will vary, my prices are based on time
Here is my price  1.50 Per hour (THIS IS JUST FOR PRINTING NO PAINT INCLUDED), if you want paint there will be a £1 Charge added.
Sadly I cannot ship items it must be local :( This may change in the future to some shippings!<p>
